"""Process-global caches: one eviction policy, one registry, one reset.

Two kinds of cache exist in the core modules and each has one spelling:

* a **table** (``dict``) interns values by text inside a constructor --
  ``Version(text)``, ``parse_requirement(text)`` -- and is bounded with
  :func:`bounded_put`;
* a **memo** (:func:`memoized`, ``functools.lru_cache``'s C cache) caches a
  pure derived function.

Both are registered where they are defined, with :func:`register_table` or
:func:`register_clear`, so :func:`clear_all` empties every one of them. The
benchmarks call it between iterations; a cache that is not registered here
silently turns a cold benchmark into a warm one, which is why
``tests/core/test_cache_registry.py`` enumerates the core modules and fails
on an unregistered cache.

Eviction is a clear-all sweep at the limit rather than LRU bookkeeping:
the tables are read on hot paths where a plain ``dict`` lookup is the whole
point, and a sweep costs one rebuild of the working set every few thousand
distinct texts.

Thread safety: none of this is synchronised. Every cached value is an
immutable value type that compares equal to whatever a concurrent caller
would have built in its place, so a lost store or a sweep that races with a
lookup is a cache miss, never a wrong answer.
