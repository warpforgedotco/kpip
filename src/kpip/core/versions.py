"""PEP 440 versions as their own ordering key.

A :class:`Version` *is* a tuple -- ``(epoch, release, suffix, local)`` --
laid out so that tuple comparison is PEP 440 ordering. Sorting, ``max``,
dict keys, bisection and the resolver's interval arithmetic all compare
Versions in C with no Python-level dunder in the way, and there is no
separate "comparison key" to keep in step with the object.

The rules that follow from that:

* A Version compares only with a Version. ``version == "1.0"`` is
  ``False`` and ``version < "1.0"`` raises ``TypeError``; parse the text
  first. (Equality with a plain tuple of the same shape holds, as for any
  tuple subclass -- do not mix the two as keys of one dict.)
* Format with f-strings or ``str()``; ``"%s" % version`` would treat the
  tuple as the argument list.
* ``marshal`` rejects the subclass, so a Version that leaks into an
  on-disk payload fails closed; :meth:`to_wire` produces the plain-tuple
  record the catalog summaries store and :meth:`from_wire` reads it.
* Instances are immutable and interned: ``Version(text)`` returns the
  instance already built for that text while it is in the table, so equal
  texts normally share one object, and the table is bounded and swept.
