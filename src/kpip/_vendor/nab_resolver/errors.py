    As raised by this package, ``str(error)`` is the finished report: the
    derivation rendered through the provider's ``narrow_for_display`` and the
    resolver's ``format_range``, so re-rendering it means supplying both again.

    The ``incompatibility`` attribute holds the root of that derivation, and is
    None where the resolver stopped before proving one. Walk ``cause_left`` and
    ``cause_right`` to trace the full proof.

    Two paths raise without a report: exceeding ``max_iterations``, which
    leaves ``incompatibility`` None, and a stalled conflict-resolution loop,
    which attaches one but reports a resolver bug. Neither proves the
    requirements unsatisfiable.

    ``verbose_message`` is the same report at more depth, set by whatever
    augments the error with what the resolve knows beyond the derivation.
    With no augmentation, it is None. ``str(error)`` returns the base
    report.
