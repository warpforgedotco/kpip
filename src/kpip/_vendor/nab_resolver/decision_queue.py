"""A lazy min-heap over the undecided packages' decision sort keys.

``choose_package_to_decide`` needs the smallest sort key in the undecided set,
and a scan moves the keys of only the handful of packages it assigns. The queue
holds the keys in a heap and calls ``sort_key`` again only for the packages a
scan marks stale. It still walks the whole undecided set, which keeps those
calls in the order a full scan made them.
