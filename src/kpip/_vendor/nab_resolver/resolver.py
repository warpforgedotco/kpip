"""PubGrub dependency resolver.

Implements unit propagation, conflict resolution with clause learning, and
non-chronological backjumping.  PubGrub was designed by Natalie Weizenbaum
for Dart's pub, adapting CDCL (conflict-driven clause learning) from SAT
solving to version resolution.

The phase functions live in :mod:`nab_resolver.propagate`,
:mod:`nab_resolver.conflict`, :mod:`nab_resolver.decide`, and
:mod:`nab_resolver.incompat_index`.  ``Resolver`` is a thin coordinator that
holds shared state and delegates to those modules.  State attributes are
named without leading underscores so the phase modules can read and mutate
them directly; the supported public API is ``__init__``, ``resolve``,
``solve``, and ``stats``.
