"""Shared SQLite connection/transaction lifecycle for kpip's persistent
metadata caches.

``WheelMetadataCache`` (metadata_cache.py) and ``CandidateMetadataCache``
(candidate_metadata_cache.py) each need the same thing underneath very
different schemas and payloads: lazily open a WAL-mode SQLite database (an
absent database reads as empty rather than being created, so a run that
only ever misses pays nothing), retry once from scratch if the file turns
out to be corrupt, and gate writes behind a dirty flag with a
commit-or-rollback transaction. That plumbing lived as two byte-for-byte
copies -- drift here is a real bug, not just untidy: a fix to one (say, a
change to the corrupt-file retry, or the busy_timeout) landing in only one
cache would silently be a bug in the other, with no test surface that
would notice, since both caches degrade the same way either way (a read
that should hit disk just counts as a miss instead).
