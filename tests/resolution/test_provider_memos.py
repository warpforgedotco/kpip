"""The provider's identity memos must follow a replaced requirement.

``NabProvider._versions`` and ``NabProvider.prioritize`` keep a fast path
keyed on the identity of the package's current ``Requirement``, in front of
the content-keyed ``_version_cache``.  That is sound only because entries in
``self.requirements`` are replaced rather than mutated as the resolver merges
dependencies -- a memo that outlived a replacement would keep serving the
version list of a wider requirement.

The invalidation is pinned directly, because the end-to-end differential
below cannot see it: a stale version count only misorders decisions, and on
graphs this small the resolver reaches the same solution either way.  The
differential still earns its place as the check that the memos do not perturb
a real resolution; it just is not what catches a broken key.
