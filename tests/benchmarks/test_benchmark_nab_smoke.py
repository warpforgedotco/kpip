"""Port of nab's offline deterministic smoke suite.

Source: ``nab-python/benchmarks/deterministic_smoke.py`` and
``nab-python/benchmarks/smoke/{fixture,scenarios}.toml`` in
https://github.com/notatallshaw/nab -- the upstream project
``kpip._vendor.nab_resolver`` is vendored from. Every resolve in that suite
is checked for its exact pins, not just wall time; these benchmarks preserve
that discipline.

Of nab's 11 smoke scenarios, 4 have no kpip equivalent and are intentionally
not ported:

* ``strategy-lowest`` / ``strategy-lowest-direct`` -- kpip's
  :class:`~kpip.resolution.api.ResolutionEngine` has no "prefer lowest
  candidate" resolution-strategy knob; it always walks candidates
  highest-first.
* ``universal-aligned`` / ``universal-independent`` -- kpip has no
  cross-target (multi-Python/multi-platform) "universal" resolve mode.

nab also resolves against an arbitrary configured target Python version
independent of the host interpreter; kpip's marker evaluation
(``kpip.core.packaging.default_environment``) always reads the actual
running interpreter. ``test_nab_smoke_extra_and_python_marker`` accounts for
that: kpip runs on 3.12 or newer, where the marker picks the leaf's 2.0.0,
not the 1.0.0 nab's Python-3.11 assumption would.
