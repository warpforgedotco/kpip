"""``kpip download`` must actually reach the caches it advertises.

``--no-cache-dir`` was accepted and then never read: ``run_download`` passed no
cache directory to anything, so downloads never cached and the flag happened to
describe the behavior by accident. Now that the caches are on by default the
flag is load-bearing, so these tests pin the wiring rather than the outcome --
where the directory ends up is the part that silently regresses.
